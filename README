Sprite Clipper is a java program for identifying and extracting video game sprites
from sprite sheets.  Blob detection is used to identify sprites, then the
identified sprites can be merge or reshaped using some simple editing functionality.
The sprites can then be saved to a directory, or they can be packed into a new,
dense sprite sheet that also has an accompanying definition file.
